# Face Recognition Based Attendance Monitoring System

**Technologies Used:** OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision) with Python, Tkinter for GUI interface

## How It Works

1. Clone the repository by entering the following command in your terminal:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Abie2023/Face-Recognition-System-in-Python.git
    ```

2. Open the `Face-Recognition-System-in-Python` folder in Visual Studio Code.
   Create a virtual environment by entering the command in the terminal:
  ```
  Python -m venv env
  ```
  Activate the environment by entering the command:
  ```
  ./env/Scripts/activate
  ```

3. Install the required libraries one by one using pip:
    ```
    pip install opencv-python
    pip install wheel
    pip install face_recognition
    pip install opencv-contrib-python
    pip install pandas
    pip install pillow
    pip install shutils
    ```


4. Run `train.py` to start using the system.
